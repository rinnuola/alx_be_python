  # Control Flow Practice

This folder contains Python practice files demonstrating **conditional statements**, **pattern matching** (`match-case`), and control flow logic.  

## Files
- **if_else.py** → Simple `if/else` example (voting eligibility).  
- **nested_if_statement.py** → Demonstrates nested `if` conditions.  
- **discount_cal_elif.py** → Uses `if-elif-else` for a discount calculator.  
- **match_case.py** → Demonstrates `match-case` with days of the week.  
- **type_match.py** → Uses `match-case` to distinguish between integers and strings.  
- **mad_lib.py** → Fun string concatenation and control flow exercise.  
- **real_analogy.py** → Real-world analogy using conditional statements.  
- **guessing_game.py** → Number guessing game using `match-case` and loops.  

## How to Run
Navigate into this folder and run any file with Python:  
```bash
cd Control_Flow_Practice
python filename.py


## Purpose
These exercises were created to practice Python control flow concepts and strengthen problem-solving skills.
